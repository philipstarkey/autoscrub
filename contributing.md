# Contributing
We welcome improvements to autoscrub!

# Process
1. Log an bug/enhancement on the bitbucket [issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/philipstarkey/autoscrub/issues). For enhancements, we encourage discussion of the enhancement before beginning coding (this is not a strict requirement, but it may result in a faster review process)
3. [Fork](https://bitbucket.org/philipstarkey/autoscrub/fork) the repository on bitbucket (this requires a bitbucket account).
4. Make the modifications
    * For small modifications, commit to the default branch in your forked repository
    * For large changes (such as new features) commit your changes to a new branch in your forked repository
5. Test your changes and make sure they are complete and you have not introduced any regressions (ensure your changes pass any automated tests we provide)
6. Update the documentation in the "docs" folder to make it consistent with your changes.
7. Complete either the [individual](https://bitbucket.org/philipstarkey/autoscrub/raw/tip/contributing-Individual.pdf) or [entity](https://bitbucket.org/philipstarkey/autoscrub/raw/tip/contributing-Entity.pdf) agreement
8. Using the bitbucket web interface for your forked repository, make a pull-request to the main autoscrub repository and attach the agreement completed in step 7. In the description of the pull request, include the text "fixes issue #num" where "num" is replaced by the issue number for the issue you logged in step 1.
8. We will review your pull-request, and may request changes to your code.
9. Once we are happy with the pull-request, we will merge in your changes.
